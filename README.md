## Description

This application is made to help the developer use some common CSS tools in one place. I made this application to improve my Angular and CSS skills, and also to help myself writting CSS files in the future. You can find the tools in the sidebar on left side of the screen. These tools are quite simple, but I think you will find it fairly useful. I certainly hope that this tool will help you save some time, and will make you feel this time was not wasted.

## Tools description

At the moment there are only three tools, but I'm planning to add new ones in the future. Here is current tools description:
-**Shape generator** - this tool helps to make some more unusual shape from div than simple square or rectangle. It lets developer create shapes like: circle, ellipse, egg, triangle, trapezoid, diamond, and many other shapes.
-**Gradient generator** - as the name suggests, it makes a gradient of chosen colors, and rotation degree. This tool allows to use a maximum of 10 colors, radial or linear direction, and gradient transform properties.
-**Banner generator** - have you ever seen a simple post on facebook, with a few words and some color or gradient in the background? This is exactly what this tool is made for. It also lets you download your effects of work.
-**Typography** - a tool to check typography, while building a text content on website. Actually this component is in building, but you can check it anyway to see a simple animation and component preliminary draft.
